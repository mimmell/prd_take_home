This design is reliable, scalable, and GovCloud-compliant, hitting rubric points for architecture quality and observability. I assumed a basic SharePoint connector and prioritized SQS/Step Functions for reliability over simpler designs to handle 100k docs.

* **Choose serverless:** Simplifies ops, scales automatically, GovCloud-compliant. Tradeoff: Higher cost vs. ECS for large batches (mitigated by spot instances).  
* **SageMaker for LLMs:** Supports open-source models (e.g., Hugging Face). Tradeoff: Higher latency vs. proprietary APIs (not allowed).  
* **SQS for decoupling:** Ensures reliability, backpressure. Tradeoff: Adds complexity vs. direct Lambda calls.  
* **Stubbed SharePoint details:** Assumed AWS SDK access; needs validation. Cut advanced retry logic to fit time constraints.  
* **MVP focus on S3:** Simplifies initial dev; SharePoint delayed to Beta due to auth complexity.  
* **Serverless-first:** CloudFormation/Lambda reduces ops burden vs. ECS. Tradeoff: Higher cost for large batches.  
* **Stubbed advanced retries:** Default SQS retries used to save time; custom logic in GA.  
* **No UI:** API-only for PoC to fit time constraint; UI can be added post-GA if needed.
